Inheritance (is-a relationship) : It is an object oreinted feature which signify sharing of properties & behaviour of one class in another class is inheritance , used to implement modularity at application level

ERP : College resources
Admin , Student , Accounts , Staff

Each module will be implemented as class & used to deploy code reusability & re-implementation

                        is-a
             Class A   <-----  Class B

class A : Base - Parent - Super class 
class B : Derived - Child - Sub class

syntax :

class Base
{
 data member
 member methods 
}

class Derived extends Base
{
 data member
 member methods 
}

Types of Inheritance :-

-> Single level inheritance
-> Multilevel level inheritance
-> Hierarchical inheritance
-> Multiple inheritance
-> Hybrid inheritance

-------------------------------------------------------

Polymorphism : It is an OOPS feature which signify poly means many 
morphism means forms 
i.e one entity having different different implementation

-> Overloading - (...) Rest operator

-> Overriding - In case of inheritance , base class property & behaviour is acquired by derived class , in this case it is possible that both base & derived may contain data or functionality with same name considered as overriding. 

In overriding base class implementation are overriden by derived class     

-------------------------------------------------------

Abstraction : It is an object oreinted feature which is used to implement application level security , by making application level data secure & functionality globally accessible.

Note : In ES6 abstraction is all about nomenculature (naming conventions) -> a:data member , aData:method 

-> public parameter : a , aData()

-> private parameter : #a , #aData() 

-------------------------------------------------------

Encapsulation : It is an object oriented 
feature , which signify wrapping of data & functionality into a single unit is encapsulation , as it wraps data hence also considered as data binding.

Note : In oops object is unit which carries encapsulation
