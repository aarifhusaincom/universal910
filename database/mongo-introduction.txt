MongoDB : It is NoSQL based database , used to manage bulk amount of unstructured data at application level. As this storage is unstructured entire data will be manages by using JS objects (JSON)

key points :-

-> Schema less DBMS
-> Entire data will be manages by using JS object hence considered as document oreinted DBMS
(document : it is JS object)
-> As schema less do not implements relations & joins like cases
-> Structure

* Database : It is virtual storage , which will come in existance as data is stored 

* Collections : Instead of table , mongodb have collections which store data as documents

* Documents : It is JS object used to store data as key:value pair , each document of collection may contain different-different keys

* fields : this are key of documents

eg : {key1:value1,key2:value2,......,keyn:valuen}; -> document

key1 , key2 , keyn -> fields
